# Analyst EDA

Welcome to the Analyst EDA repository! This repository will serve as my starting point for my career as an analyst. Here, I will be performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on various datasets from different data sources.

## What is EDA?

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. Here are some key points about EDA:

- **Understanding Data:** EDA helps in understanding the underlying structure of the data.
- **Detecting Outliers:** It helps in identifying outliers or anomalies in the dataset.
- **Finding Patterns:** EDA is used to uncover patterns, relationships, or trends in data.
- **Validating Assumptions:** It assists in validating assumptions and hypotheses about the data.

## Why is EDA Needed?

EDA is a crucial step in data analysis for the following reasons:

- **Data Cleaning:** It helps in detecting and correcting errors and inconsistencies in the data.
- **Insight Generation:** EDA provides insights that guide further analysis and model development.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** It allows analysts to test hypotheses and draw preliminary conclusions.
- **Visualization:** EDA uses visualizations to make data understandable and interpretable.

## How is EDA Done?

Here are the typical steps involved in performing EDA:

1. **Data Collection:** Gathering data from various sources.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, correcting errors, and ensuring data consistency.
3. **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing the data using statistical measures like mean, median, and mode.
4. **Data Visualization:** Using charts, graphs, and plots to visualize data distributions and relationships.
5. **Correlation Analysis:** Identifying correlations between variables.
6. **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features based on existing data to improve analysis.

## Datasets

I will be performing EDA on several datasets from different sources, including:

- CSV files
- SQL databases
- APIs
- JSON files

## Projects

Stay tuned for various EDA projects on datasets related to:

- Finance
- Health
- Marketing
- Technology

Each project will include:

- Detailed analysis reports
- Visualizations
- Insights and findings

## Getting Started

To get started with the analyses:

1. Clone this repository:
   
   git clone https://github.com/Harsha2001-creater/Analyst-EDA.git
   
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   
   cd Analyst-EDA
   
4. Follow the instructions in individual project folders to run the analyses.
